# TUF runtime requirements plus securesystemslib with extra dependencies
#
# This file together with 'pip-compile' is used to generate a pinned
# requirements file with all immediate and transitive dependencies.
#
# 'requirements-pinned.txt' is updated on GitHub with Dependabot, which
# triggers CI/CD builds to automatically test against updated dependencies.
#
#
# NOTE: 'pip-compile' only adds dependencies relevant for the Python version,
# in which it is executed. Moreover, it does not add environment markers of
# transitive dependencies.
# The official recommendation for cross-environment usage of pip-compile tends
# towards separate requirements files for each environment (see
# jazzband/pip-tools#651), this seem like an overkill for tuf, where we only
# have a few conditional dependencies, i.e. dependencies that are required on
# Python < 3 only.
#
#
# Below instructions can be used to re-generate 'requirements-pinned.txt', e.g.
# if:
# - requirements are added or removed from this file
# - Python version support is changed
# - CI/CD build breaks due to updates (e.g. transitive dependency conflicts)
#
# ./update-requirements.sh
